#Javascript Variables  

Like moving boxes, variables have names that tells us what's inside. After creating  
a variable, we use the equals sign to assign a value to it. And to end, we put a  
semi-colon at the end.  

Every variable needs a name, name variables need to be a single word and have no spaces.  
To create variable names with multiple words, we use camel case. We start with lowercase  
and capitalize additional words.  

To help us understand what's inside a variable, we use descriptive names. We use let for  
values that do vary and const for values that don't.  

If we try to update a value with the keyword, const, we get an error.
